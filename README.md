## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

### Screenshot

![Desktop](./public/screenshots/desktop.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Smooth transitions and animations.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [ViteJs](https://styled-components.com/) - A very fast dev tool to launch light project.

### What I learned

- Got more acquitted with styled-components.
- Animation and transitions with Framer motion.

### Continued development

- As I further my skills with react, I am happy with my continuous development with it and on the way learning more about react library styled components, Frame-motion.
